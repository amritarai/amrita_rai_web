    <h2>About Tobias Eaton</h2>

<p>Tobias Eaton is a 18 year old from Abnegation. He had lived a very difficult past. While he was still young his mother; Evelyn Eaton, had apparently died, leaving Tobias with his father, Marcus Eaton. Tobias grew up being a victim of abuse from his father.
	During his aptitude test, his result was Abnegation but he chose to go with Dauntless instead to escape his father. During his initiation, during the fear factor stage, it was discovered that Tobias only had four fears; one of them being his father.
	The average amout of fears is between 10 to fiftteen. His being the lowest number in history had gotten him his new name; Four. From then on he was called Four, hs old name being forgotten. Tobias ends up placing first in his initiation class. After
	he settles into Dauntless, he chooses to work as a initiate instructor every year and in the intelligence sector in Dauntless. When Tris first meets Tobias, he comes off as cold and reserved. Since he grew up in an abusive home, his father didn't let
	him talk to the other kids, so he didn't really learn any social skills. </p>
    <p>There is also a book called "Four," which is a collection of stories told from Tobias' point of view.</p>
