<h2>Summary of the Divergent Series</h2>
<p>The series is about a 16 year old girl named Beatrice (Tris) Prior. Tris lives in a futuristic world in which society is divided into five factions; Dauntless, Abnegation, Erudite, Amity, and Candor. On a certain day every year, every person who had turned
    16 years old must go through a simulation to see what faction they fit into. They would then choose their faction in the choosing ceremony, in which each person is called up one by one and let's their blood drip into one of the five pots that are in
    the center of the stage. Once they pick a faction, they are put through a series of tests to see if they actually fit into that faction. These tests can last for a few weeks to a few months. During her initiation she discovers that she is divergent. Being divergent means
    that she is genetically different from the rest. Divergents are considered a threat to society, they are seen as the enemy that needs to be eliminated. Tris and Tobias, along with a few others, are soon on the run from the people trying to rid the world
    of divergents. </p>
<hr>
    <p><img src="dauntless.png" alt="dauntless" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">Dauntless is a faction that values bravery. They value courage, bravery, strength, intimidation, and fearlessness. Dauntless was formed by a group of people that
        blamed fear and cowardice that causes all the problems in society. Memebers of the faction usually wear black, have piercings, have tattoos, and are usually seen running around the city, doing things that they would consider fun but most others would
        cinsider dangerous and idiotic.</p>
<hr>    
    
<p><img src="abnegation.jpg" alt="abnegation" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">Abnegation is a faction that values selflessness. They decided to serve others and put everyone before themselves. They are the only faction that helps the factionless;
    poeple that were kicked out of their faction or had committed crimes and were kicked out. Abnegation was formed by a group of people who blamed selfishness for the main cause of most problems. The Abnegation wear grey because they consider it a selfless
    colour. It is dull and it draws no attention to themselves. Their clothes are baggy, they like to be conservative, they aren't comfortable with showing skin. Physical display of affection isn't allowed and is frowned upon. The members are supposed
    to keep ther hair short; the women usually pin it up while the men keep it short. The only type of accessory they are allowed to wear is a simple grey watch. The leader of this facion is Marcus Eaton; Tobias' dad.</p>
<hr>
<p>
    <img src="erudite.jpg" alt="erudite" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">The smart ones that value intelligence, logic, and wisdom are in Erudite. Erudite was formed by people who blamed human ignorance for everything wrong in society.
    People in the faction must have a drive to always learn more and question everything. They are taught to question everything around them and that facts and science are the only answers. The colour that they wear is blue. Each member should wear one
    article of blue clothing everyday. They consider blue a calming colour that stimulates the brain. Some members of the faction wear think rimmed glasses just so they appear smarter. The leader of this faction is Jeanine Matthews, she is also the antagonist;
 trying to control the minds of everyone in Abnegation and getting rid of all divergents. Erudite claim that everything about Abnegation is fake, and they're actually very greedy. </p>
<hr>
<p><img src="amity.jpg" alt="amity" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">The ones that only want peace and happiness are the Amity. Amity are all about kindess and harmony. The members value peacefulness, kindness, forgiveness, and trust. They
    are also the faction that farms all the food. They are a democratic faction, they vote on almost anything, but they still use Johanna Reyes as their representative. They dislike fighting so much that they put a peace serum into their bread to keep
    from fighting. Members of Amity wear colours that are bright, such as red and yellow. Their clothing is less formal than the other factions.</p>
<hr>
<p> <img src="candor.jpg" alt="candor" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">Lastly, Candor values order and the truth. They don't care how much the turth hurts, they will say it. None of the members have a filter, they say whatever comes to
    mind. They would rather be told the cold, hard truth than be lied to. Their colours are black and white because they believe the truth is black and white. Members of this faction usually dress formally, men almost always dressed up in suits and ties
    and women wearing long skirts. Many children that are born into Candor usually switch into Dauntless because the factions can be closely related.
