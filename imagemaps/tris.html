    <h2> About Tris Prior</h2>

    <p>Beatrice (Tris) Prior is a 16 year old girl from Abnegation. Abnegation is one of the five factions which represents selflessness. Growing up Tris always thought she would never leave the faction that she grew up in. She thought she would always be
        putting others needs before her own, and helping the factionless. Despite this, she found herself not truly following her faction's virtues. She would often find herself thinking about her needs and her wants. For this, she was often scolded by
        her brother for her selfishness.</p>

    <p>When Tris goes through the simulation, she is made to choose between cheese and a knife. She refuses to pick any of them and questions the whole thing. When she gets out of the simulation she is met with a baffled Tori Wu, who tells her that she is
        divergent. Meaning, she was matched with three factions; Dauntless, Abnegation, and Erudite. Tori warns her to never tell anyone of this, and that she will delete her results from the system. Soon afterwards, all 16 year olds went to the choosing
        ceremony to pick what faction they want to be in for the rest of their lives. Tris has a hard time coosing where she wants to go. Whether she would like to stay at home where her family is, in Abnegatiion, or join Dauntless; the fearless. When
        it is her turn to choose it turns into a very hard decision, so she closes her eye, slits her hand and lets her blood drip onto the coal. She picked Dauntless.</p>

    <p>Getting into Dauntless is a huge challenge for her. She would be coming in last place for almost anything, but she was determined so she would train every chance she got and eventually got into Dauntless while being very close to first place. During
        the fear factor stage of her initiation, they had found out that she only had six fears, the second lowest. Throughout her training, she grew very close with Tobias since he was her instructor. They both had found that they knew each other as
        kids and Tobias had opened up to her. Tobias and Tris couldn't tell anyone that they were dating because then they both would have been kicked out of Dauntless and left factionless. She has told everyone the night her initiation had ended. The
        next day there was an attack on all divergents, that was when the head of Erudite was trying to kill all divergents because they were supposedly a threat to society. Tobias and Tris were the only ones that were not under affectof the drugs that
        everyone else had taken, because of their divergence. They both had to save themsleves and were on a run from then on, trying tosave all divergents and trying to make peace. </p>
