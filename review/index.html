        <p>The 100 is a TV series on CW. It is about a world that ended. About 99 years earlier a bunch of nuclear bombs had gone off, which resulted in radiation spreading everywhere. The radiation had supposedly killed off everyone that didn't escape.
            The ones that did escape the bombs, fled to space. 12 nations launched into space and those spaceships connected together to make one massive one. That one spaceship was called the Ark. They stayed up in space for alomst hundred years, until
            they had to return to earth because their spaceship was running out of air. The "100" were sent to the ground to see if Earth is now habitable. The people that were sent to the ground are a group of kids that don't go past the age of 18, except
            for one person. The 100 are exactly 100 people. They all had committed some sort of crime and were thrown in jail, and were going to be excecuted at the age of 18. Instead of being excecuted, they were sent to the ground. During their time
            on the ground, they discover that they aren't the only ones. There are people that survived the nuclear explosions, those people are reffered to as the "Grounders". Soon everyone else on the Ark, follow the 100 down. They all struggle to live
            with the Grounders in peace, and over come many obstacles along the way. For example, saving the world from another nuclear explosion.

                    <h1>Character Descriptions: </h1>
                    <h2>Bellamy Blake:</h2>
                    <p>Bellamy is the leading male character. He is one of the most important characters. His character is played by Bob Morley. Up on the Ark he was training to become a guard, a job that he really wanted. However, that is taken away from
                        him once the guards find out he has a sister. Up on the Ark it is illegal to have more than one child. This is a law because, they don't want the food to run out too quickly or run out of air too fast. His sister lived her whole
                        life hiding under the floor boards, never leaving the room. Once she was found she was thrown into jail, to be excecuted at age 18. Bellamy was forced to leave his job as a guard and become a janitor and his mother was excecuted.
                        When he found out that his sister and the others were being sent to the ground, he came up with a plan to go with them. He shot the man in charge in hopes to kill him and ran into the ship before it took off. Down on the ground,
                        he and Clarke Griffin both struggled with each other for leadership over the 100. Bellamy was sick of being controlled and hated how the Ark treated him, he wanted his new life to have a lot of freedom. He went with a new saying
                        that went "What ever the hell we want." It was only after a suicide of another character, that he realized that he needed to set some rules and lead just like Clarke was trying to. Throughout the series he changes so much because
                        of everything that he goes through. Bellamy's character change was one of the biggest in the series.</p>

                    <hr></hr>

                    <h2>Clarke Griffin:</h2>
                    <p>Clark is the leading female character. She is played by Eliza Jane. On the Ark she was thrown into jail because she knew that the Ark was running out of air, and they didn't want her telling anyone and causing panic. The authorities
                        on the Ark decided put her into jail and excecute her at the age of 18. She was a medical student, following her mother's footsteps. Clarke is one of the people among the 100 that was sent to the ground. She was struggling for
                        leadership over the delinqents with Bellamy but over time Bellamy and Clarke got along. Clarke wants what is best for the 100, she wants to survive, and does anything to do so. Throughout the series she is called "Wanheda," which
                        means "commander of death," she got this name because she had killed off a whole colony, and held no remorse. As it was stated before, she will do anything to make sure she survives and the rest of the 100 does too. </p>

                    <hr></hr>

                    <h2>Raven Reyes:</h2>
                    <p>Raven is a major character throughhout the series. She is played by Lindsey Morgan. On Earth, she is a mechanic. During the war in season one, she was in charge of making explosives and making ammunition for their weapons. Raven didn't
                        come down with the 100, she came on her own by stealing a drop ship. Her boyfriend, Finn, was imprisoned when he took the blame for something Raven did. Up on the Ark, Raven decided that she wanted to go out into space in a spacesuit.
                        She didn't close the door properly and all the air from the Ark got sucked out. She ended up wasting a month's worth of air. Finn was there too, when the gards came running he said it was him. If Raven were to go to jail, she would
                        have been executed immediatly because she was over 18 years old. When she found out that he was sent to the ground with the 100, she took the drop ship, and went to earth, with the help of Clarke's mother. Deeper into the series,
                        Raven suffers from nerve damage in her leg, from a gunshot injury she recieved from Murphy. Through the series, she suffers a lot with her leg, it has been bringing her a lot of pain and affecting her back. Overall, Raven is a
                        very headstrong character. She is very tough on the outside, she doesn't like it when people see her at her most vulnerable moments. </p>

                    <hr></hr>

                    <h2>John Murphy:</h2>
                    <p>John, who goes by Murphy, is apart of the original 100. At first he was a terrible person. He was Bellamy's second-in-command, he was doing perfectly fine until he was wrongly accused of murdering Clarke's bestfriend. It all went downhill
                        for him from there. The delinquents has tried to hang him but Clarke saved him by ctting the rope. He was banished from the campsite, and was captured by the Grounder, where he was tortured. Murphy later retured to the camp, but
                        he had a very dangerous illness which soon spread to everyone else. After he gets better, he tries to hang Bellamy and murders two people who were involved in his hanging. On the Ark, he was thrown into jail because he had become
                        terribly ill. His father didn't have the medicine to make him feel better, so he stole it in desperation to help Murphy. His father was caught and was immediatly excecuted. His mother started drinking very heavily because of her
                        husband's death, and that soon lead to her death. Her last words were her blaming Murphy for the death of his father. After his mother died, Murphy was arrested. In the begginning of the series Murphy was terrible, but over time
                        he realized that if he wants to survive he'll have to get along with everyone. As the series continued, he soon finds a love interest and they go off toegther because she isn't accepted into society becuse of how she was born.
                        His charater development is probably my favourite out of them all.</p>
