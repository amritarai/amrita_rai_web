        <p>The 100 is a TV series on CW. It is about a world that ended. A few hundred years ago a bunch of nuclear bombs had gone off, which resulted in radiation spreading everywhere. The radiation had supposedly killed off everyone that didn't escape. The ones that did escape the bombs, fled to space. They stayed up in space for alomst hundred years, until they had to return to earth because their spaceship was running out of air. The "100" were sent to the ground to see if earth is now habitable. The people that were sent to the ground are a group of kids that don't go past the age of 18, except for one person. They all have committed some sort of crime and were thrown in jail, and were going to be excecuted at the age of 18. Instead os being excecuted, they were sent to the ground. During their time on the ground, they discover that they aren't the only ones. There are people that survived the nuclear explosions, those people are reffered to as the "Grounders". Soon everyone else on the spaceship, also known as the Ark, follow the 100 down. They all struggle to live with the Grounders in peace, and over come many obstacles along the way. For example, saving the world from another nuclear explosion.

        <h1>Character Descriptions: </h1>
            <h2>Bellamy Blake:</h2>
            <p>Bellamy is the leading male character. He is one of the most important characters. His character is played by Bob Morley. Up on the Ark he was training to become a guard, a job that he really wanted. However, that is taken away from him once the guards find out he has a sister. Up on the Ark it is illegal to have more than one child. This is a law because, they don't want the food to run out to quickly His sister lived her whole life hiding under the floor boards, never leaving the room. Once she was found she was thrown into jail, to be excecuted at age 18. Bellamy was forced to leave his job as a guard and become a janitor. When he found out that his sister and the others were being sent to the ground, he came up with a plan to go with them. He shot the man in charge in hopes to kill him and ran into the ship before it took off. Down on the ground, he and Clarke Griffin both struggled with each other for leadership over the 100. Bellamy was sick of being controlled and hated how the ark treated him, he wanted his new life to have a lot of freedom. It was only after a suicide of another character, that he realized that he needed to set some rules and lead just like Clarke was trying to. Throughout the series he changes so much because of all that he goes through. Bellamy's character change was one of the biggest in the series.</p>

            <h2>Clarke Griffin:</h2> 
            <p>Clark is the leading female character. On the Ark she was thrown into jail because she knew that the Ark was running out of air, and they didn't want her telling anyone and causing panic, so they put her into jail and were going to excecute her at 18. She was a medical student, following in her mother's footsteps. Clarke is one of the people among the 100 that was sent to the ground. She was struggling over who was going to be a leader for the delinquents. Over time Bellamy and Clarke got along. Clarke wants what is best for the 100, she wants to survive, and does anything to do so. Throughout the series she is called "Wanheda". Which means the commander of death, she got this name because she killed off a whole colony, and had no remorse. As it was stated before, she will do anything to make sure she survives and the rest of the the 100 does too. </p>

            <h2>Raven Reyes:</h2>
            <p>Raven is a major character throughout the series. On Earth, she is a mechanic. During the war in season one, she was in charge of making explosives and making ammunition for their weapons. Raven didn't come down with the 100, she came on her own by stealing a little ship. Her boyfriend, Finn, was imprisoned when he took the blame for something Raven did. Up on the Ark, Raven decided that she wanted to go out into space in a spacesuit. She didn't close the door properly and all the air from the Ark got sucked out. She ended up wasting a month's worth of air. Finn was there too, when the gards came running he said it was him. If Raven were to go to jail, she would have been executed immediatly because she was over 18 years old. When she found out that he was sent to the ground with the 100, she took the little space ship, and went to earth, with the help of Clarke's mother.</p>
